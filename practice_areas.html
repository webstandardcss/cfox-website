    <h3><a href="#section1">Personal Injury/ Wrongful Death</a></h3>
    <div>
        <p>If you are injured or a family member is deceased because of the wrongful conduct of a person or persons, you, as the injured party or the heir of the decedent may file a wrongful death action against those responsible for the injury or the decedent's
            death. This area of Tort Law is governed by Texas state statute. In general the statute defines who may sue for injury due to wrongful conduct or wrongful death and what, if any, limits may be applied to an award of damages.</p>
        <ul>
            <blockquote>
                <li class="txt_blue">Personal Injury</li>
                <p>A legal term for an injury to the body, mind or emotions, as opposed to an injury to property. The term is most commonly used to refer to a type of tort lawsuit alleging that the plaintiff's injury has been caused by the negligence of
                    another, but also arises in defamation torts.</p>
                <li class="txt_blue">Wrongful Death</li>
                <p>A claim in common law jurisdictions against a person who can be held liable for a death. The claim is brought in a civil action, usually by close relatives, as enumerated by statute.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </ul>
        <p class="animate">If you've been recently injured or suffered the loss of a loved one in a wrongful death accident, it is critical that you seek assistance as soon as possible to investigate your case. You need a competent attorney such as Christina Fox to help
            preserve your rights.</p>

            evaluate the particulars of your case and help you come to a conclusion as to how you'd like to proceed. We understand the need to alleviate some of the stress involved in these kinds of decisions and we'll work with you to determine a proper
            course of action.</p>

                <li class="txt_blue">Divorce</li>
                <p>A divorce is the termination of a marriage by a legal proceeding or in a court. Divorces are generally categorized as contested or uncontested. In a contested divorce, the parties cannot agree on at least one issue, while in an uncontested
                    divorce, the parties agree to all terms. Texas does not have specific provisions for a legal separation, but allows for temporary orders to be filed at the time the divorce is filed. In cases where the parties have filed for a divorce
                    or civil annulment, the spouses may enter into a written agreement concerning the division of the property and the liabilities of the spouses and maintenance of either spouse.</p>
                <li class="txt_blue">Child Custody</li>
                <p>If you and your spouse agree on who will have custody of the children, the court will almost always approve your written agreement. If you and your spouse cannot decide on an agreement, the court will decide custody and appoint one spouse
                    as the Sole Managing Conservator of the child/children. A custody battle can be extremely expensive and destructive.</p>
                <li class="txt_blue">Child Support</li>
                <p>Child support payments are calculated by schedules developed by each state and based on parents' incomes and expenses and their children's daily living expenses, education, health, and other needs. Parents must provide for their children
                    based on the their circumstances and "station in life"; the goal is to ensure that children share in the standard of living of both parents.</p>
                <li class="txt_blue">Spousal Support</li>
                <p>In Texas the support payments when applicable, can influence how the marital property distribution is awarded, which is why it can become a very intricate part of the final outcome of any divorce. Keeping this in mind, if you and your
                    spouse are unable to reach and agreement on this issue, the District Court will order support from one spouse to the other on a case-by-case basis based upon several factors including job skills, financial resources, age and employment
                    history, etc.</p>

    <h3><a href="#section3">Consumer and Business Bankruptcy</a></h3>
    <div>
        <p>Millions of people have turned to filing bankruptcy to eliminate debt and stop foreclosure. In the current economic environment in particular, bankruptcy is seen as a viable option for those overwhelmed by debt and unable to pay their bills. Texas
            residents or businesses may file for bankruptcy if they are unable to keep up on debt repayment. Bankruptcy is the process that occurs when you are unable to pay your debts and ask a court for assistance in either discharging (or forgiving)
            some of the money you owe or coming up with a plan to repay creditors.</p>
        <ul>
            <blockquote>
                <li class="txt_blue">Chapter 7 for Individuals or Businesses</li>
                <p>Chapter 7 bankruptcy, sometimes called a straight bankruptcy is an asset liquidation proceeding. It tends to be the least complicated and usually takes the least amount of time to administer. The debtor releases all non-exempt property
                    to the bankruptcy trustee who then converts it to cash for distribution to the creditors. The debtor receives a discharge of all dischargeable debts usually within four months. In the vast majority of cases the debtor has no assets
                    that he would lose so Chapter 7 will give that person a relatively quick "fresh start".</p>
                <li class="txt_blue">Chapter 13 (Individuals only)</li>
                <p>Chapter 13 Bankruptcy is also known as a reorganization bankruptcy, gives debtors the opportunity to become current with their delinquent accounts while still keeping their property. Chapter13 bankruptcy is filed by individuals who want
                    to pay off their debts over a period of three to five years. It is only an option for individuals who have predictable income and whose income is sufficient to pay their expenses with some left over to pay off their debts.</p>
                <li class="txt_blue">Chapter 11 (Businesses Only)</li>
                <p>Chapter 11 bankruptcy, also known as a business bankruptcy, is for corporations that have the potential to be a viable business if it were free from debt. This bankruptcy would allow the business to restructure secured debts, reduce unsecured
                    debts and still continue to operate. It will help the business owner put a Plan of Reorganization in place so that the business can continue to flourish once the bankruptcy is completed. The goal of a Chapter 11 is to propose a plan
                    that will make a struggling business a more profitable business.</p>

    <h3><a href="section4">Criminal Defense</a></h3>
    <div>
        <p>Criminal punishments for crimes are outlined in the Texas State Penal Code. For each crime committed such as DWIs, Drug Crimes, Other Felonies and Misdemeanors, there are a variety of defenses a defendant may use to prove his innocence, argue
            for the case to be dismissed or have his sentence reduced. For the criminal defendant to be found guilty the prosecuting attorney must prove the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If you've been accused of a crime, it is important
            that you get competent legal counsel, such as Christina Fox, Attorney at Law, as soon as possible.</p>
        <ul>
            <blockquote>
                <li class="txt_blue">Felony</li>
                <p>A felony is a serious criminal offense for which you can be fined up to $10,000 and be sentenced to a state penitentiary for a period of between six months and life. You also may lose your right to vote, have a gun or obtain certain state
                    occupational licenses. Felonies include aggravated assault, burglary and DWI, third offense.</p>
                <li class="txt_blue">Misdemeanor</li>
                <p>On the other hand, a misdemeanor is a less serious criminal offense for which you can be fined $4,000 or less and be sentenced to county jail for up to one year. You do not lose any civil rights for a misdemeanor conviction. Misdemeanors
                    include simple assault, theft and DWI, first or second offense.</p>
                <li class="txt_blue">Traffic Ticket Defense</li>
                <p>The State of Texas can suspend your driver's license if you accumulate too many tickets, or you fail to address an outstanding ticket. If you fail to pay a traffic ticket and miss a court date, a failure to appear (FTA) warrant may be
                    issued for your arrest. So the question is, what options do you have? You could not pay the fine and hope to avoid being arrested, but this is your worst option. If you choose this option, more than likely, you will end up paying the
                    fine plus additional fees, AND you could be denied renewal of your driver's license. Of course, you could plead "guilty" or "no contest" and pay the fine, but that would be recorded on your driving record, AND could result in higher
                    insurance rates.</p>
                <p>Your best option may be to plead "not guilty" and post a bond in court to lift the warrant. You will no longer be subject to arrest, and you will have the opportunity to fight your traffic ticket. This is how we can help you. Contact our
                    office to hear more about your options.</p>
